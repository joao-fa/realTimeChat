# Real Time Chat Application

Here is a live chat application including both back and front-end code. The main purpose of this repository is to provide my way of implementing the JavaScript Mastery project (it means that this code is based on adrianhajdin tutorial, as shown in video "Build and Deploy a Realtime Chat Application - Socket.io, Node.js, and React.js").
An important note is that this code, nowadays, is a little outdated, since cors policy errors can come up depending on your local machine. Said that, it is highly recommended that you have installed in your browser some kind of dealt to this problem (extention "Allow Cors" in Google Chrome for example).

Therefore, here is the live chat link: https://5fbee11ad86d67627e860042--cranky-turing-4ada52.netlify.app/
Enjoy it!
